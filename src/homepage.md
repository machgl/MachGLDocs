# Mach::GL Documentation

Mach::GL is an OpenGL game engine that combines the ease of high-level programming with the control of low level access. 

### Current features:
  - High performance 2D & 3D renderers
  - Framebuffers
  - OBJ file loading 
  - Texture mipmapping and anisotropic filtering
  - Random terrain generation
  - Keyboard & mouse input
  - GLSL shader loaders
  - HDR
  - Static environment maps for objects (from loaded cubemap)
  - Dynamic skyboxes 
  - API Abstraction
  - Dynamic enviornment maps for objects
  - Scenes
  
 ### Currently working on: 
  - Particle system
  - Texture atlases 
  - Documenting code
  - Post-processing effects (bloom effects etc.)
  - Scene file saving/loading (using YAML)
  - OpenAL support 
  
 ### Features I want to add soon:
  - Scene editor
  - Mesh simplifier 
  - Normal maps
  - Shadows
  - Lua scripting
  - FBX file loading (for faster 3D object loading)
  - 3D physics using PhysX (including a non-nVidia alternative) 
  - Vulkan support
